# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Prediction using Decision Tree and Tkinter

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is a **machine learning application** that predicts the species of an Iris flower (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`) based on its **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.  

A **Decision Tree Classifier** is trained on the famous **Iris dataset** using **scikit-learn**.  
The trained model is saved with **Joblib** and integrated into a **Tkinter-based GUI**, where users can input flower measurements and instantly get predictions about the species.  

The GUI provides:
- User-friendly input fields for the flower features  
- A "Predict" button to classify the flower  
- Real-time display of the predicted species  

This project demonstrates the integration of **Machine Learning** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** in Python.
